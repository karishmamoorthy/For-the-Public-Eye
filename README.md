# Highlights

Dear reader, this folder contains *some* of my best codes from the past year. Some of them are from a university-requisite Python coding course. Some of them are from Physics assignments I have had to do this year. The rest are my attempts at using Python to understand basic ideas - generally pertaining to Physics.
